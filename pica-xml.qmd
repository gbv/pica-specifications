# PICA XML

PICA XML (without XML Namespace) was introduced in the early 2000s to serve PICA+ records via SRU. In 2006 the format was documented at VZG with XML Namespace and XML Schema, and a stable version 1.0 was published at July 3rd, 2008^[See <https://web.archive.org/web/20080913003622/http://www.gbv.de/wikis/cls/PICA_XML_Version_1.0>]. OCLC decided against officially adopting it, so alternative forms of encoding PICA in XML have evolved.

PICA XML is listed at <https://www.loc.gov/standards/sru/recordSchemas/> with identifier `info:srw/schema/5/picaXML-v1.0`.

## Schemas

The following Schemas can be used to validate PICA XML. Not all aspects of PICA are covered.

The XML Schema (XSD) is also available at <https://www.loc.gov/standards/sru/recordSchemas/pica-xml-v1-0.xsd>.

The Document Type Definition (DTD) defines a superset of PICA XML without restriction on attribute values and without namespace requirement.
